# QuickDialog


**Quick and simple dialogs for iOS developers.**

QuickDialog allows you to create HIG-compliant iOS forms for your apps  without having to directly deal with UITableViews, delegates and data sources. Fast and efficient, you can create forms with multiple text fields, or with thousands of items with no sweat!

QuickDialog support many different built-in types of elements for your forms, like Entry elements, on/off elements, sliders and even simple web addresses that automatically open browsers and adress elements to open map views. For a complete list of elements, look below! The framework also is very extensible, making it simple for you to create your custom elements an cells.  

And if you don't like the basic look of controls, simply override one method and you'll have full control of the cells being displayed. Can't get much simpler than that!

Download the project and run the demo app, I'm sure you'll like how simple it is to create powerful dialogs!

*QuickDialog is inspired in the brilliant MonoTouch.Dialog library created by Miguel de Icaza, which can be found at https://github.com/migueldeicaza/MonoTouch.Dialog.*

OBS: You'll need to use the XCode 4.2 beta to run this code, as the library depends on ARC for memory management. If you're interested in helping with development, please contact me! I would appreciate any help!
